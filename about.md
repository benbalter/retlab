A good person!   
When you browse webpage use browser such as Chrome, if it show "This page is trying to load scripts from unauthenticated source." warning, just ignore it. If you click **"ctrl+shift+j"**, it will show the reason is I use the **MathJax** in the page for the mathematical formula.    

    {% highlight html %}
    <script type="text/javascript"    
      src="http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML">    
    </script>
