> Every piecewise continuous function is *Riemann integrable*. Lebesgue integral can handle a very large class of functions, including all the Riemann integrable functions, but also even very discontinuous functions. In fact, it's safe to say that it can integrate any function that one actually needs in mathematics in real-life applications.

The passage from Riemann's theory of integration to that of Lebesque is a process of completion. It is of the same fundamental importance in analysis as is the construction of the real number system from the rationals.
### **Set Notations and Terminology**
The words *collection*, *family*, and *class* will be used synonymously with set.
##### **Cartesian product**
The *cartesian product* $$A_1 \times\dddot\times A_n$$ of the sets $$A_1, \dddot, A_n$$ is the set of all ordered $$n-tuples(a_1, \dddot, a_n)$$ where $$a_i \in A_i$$ for $$i=1,...,n$$.

The *real number system* is $$R^1$$, and $$R^k = R^1 \times \dddot \times R^1$$. The *extended real number system* is $$R^1$$ with $$-\infty$$ and $$\infty$$.

##### **Supremum and Infimum**
If $$E\subset[-\infty,\infty]$$ and $$E\ne\varnothing$$, the least upper bound(supremum) and greatest lower bound(infimum) of $$E$$ exist in $$[-\infty,\infty]$$ and are denoted by *sup* $$E$$ and *inf* $$E$$.

##### **Topological space**
In mathematics, a *structure* on a set is an additional mathematical object that, in some manner, attaches (or relates) to that set to endow it with some additional meaning or significance. In modern mathematics *spaces* are defined as sets with some added structure.
