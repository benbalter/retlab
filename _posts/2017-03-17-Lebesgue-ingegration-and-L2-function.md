> Every piecewise continuous function is *Riemann integrable*. Lebesgue integral can handle a very large class of functions, including all the Riemann integrable functions, but also even very discontinuous functions. In fact, it's safe to say that it can integrate any function that one actually needs in mathematics in real-life applications.

The passage from Riemann's theory of integration to that of Lebesque is a process of completion. It is of the same fundamental importance in analysis as is the construction of the real number system from the rationals.
