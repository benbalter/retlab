> The *limit* is a concept which on one level is quite intuitive, but to pin down rigorously turns out to be quite difficult.  

### **Limit Notion**
To get real numbers from retional numbers, that is to pass from a "discrete" system to a "continuous" one, and requires the *limit* notion.  
##### **Cauchy sequences**
A sequence $$(a_n)_{n=0}^\infty$$ of rational numbers is said to be a *Cauchy sequence* iff for every $$\varepsilon \gt 0$$, there exists an $$N \ge 0$$ such that $$d(a_j, a_k) \le \varepsilon$$ for all $$j,k \ge N$$.  
##### **Real numbers**
A real number is defined to be an object of the form $$LIM_{n\rightarrow\infty} a_n$$, where $$(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty$$ is a Cauchy sequence of rational numbers.  Two real numbers $$LIM_{n\rightarrow\infty} a_n$$ and $$LIM_{n\rightarrow\infty} b_n$$ are said to be equal iff $$(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty$$ and $$(b_n)_{n=1}^\infty$$ are equivalent Cauchy sequences.  
##### **Cauchy sequences of reals**
Let $$\varepsilon \gt 0$$ be a real number. A sequence $$(a_n)_{n=m}^\infty$$ starting at some integer index $$m$$ is said to be *eventually $$\varepsilon$$-steady* iff there exists an $$N \ge m$$ such that $$(a_n)_{n=m}^\infty$$ is $$\varepsilon$$-steady. We say that $$(a_n)_{n=m}^\infty$$ is a *Cauchy sequence* iff it is eventually $$\varepsilon$$-steady for every $$\varepsilon \gt 0$$.  
##### **Convergence of sequences**
Let $$\varepsilon \gt 0$$ be a real number, and let $$L$$ be a real number. A sequence $$(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty$$ of real numbers is said to be $$\varepsilon$$-close to $$L$$ iff an is $$\varepsilon$$-close to $$L$$ for every $$n \ge N$$, i.e., we have $$|a_n - L| \le \varepsilon$$ for every $$n \ge N$$. We say that a sequence $$(a_n)_{n=m}^\infty$$ is eventually $$\varepsilon$$-close to $$L$$ iff there exists an $$N \ge m$$ such that $$(a_n)_{n=1}^\infty$$ is $$\varepsilon$$-close to $$L$$. We say that a sequence $$(a_n)_{n=m}^\infty$$ *converges* to $$L$$ iff it is eventually $$\varepsilon$$-close to $$L$$ for every real $$\varepsilon \gt 0$$.  
Convergent sequences are Cauchy.
##### **Uniqueness of limits**
Let $$(a_n)_{n=m}^\infty$$ be a real sequence starting at some integer index $$m$$, and let $$L \neq L'$$ be two distinct real numbers. Then it is not possible for $$(a_n)_{n=m}^\infty$$ to converge to $$L$$ while also converging to $$L'$$.  
##### **Limits of sequences**
If a sequence $$(a_n)_{n=m}^\infty$$ converges to some real number $$L$$, we say that $$(a_n)_{n=m}^\infty$$ is *convergent* and that its limit is $$L$$; we write <center>$$L = \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} a_n$$</center> denote this fact. If a sequence $$(a_n)_{n=m}^\infty$$ is not converging to any real number $$L$$, we say that the sequence $$(a_n)_{n=m}^\infty$$ is *divergent* and we leave $$\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} a_n$$ an undefined.  
### **Series**
The difference between "sum" and "series" is a subtle linguistic one. Strictly speaking, a series is an expression of the form $$\sum_{i=m}^n a_i$$; this series is mathematically (but not semantically) equal to a real number, which is then the sum of that series.  
##### **absolutely convergent**
We say that this series is *absolutely convergent* iff the series $$\sum_{(n=m)}^\infty |a_n|$$ is convergent.
##### **Fubini's theorem for infinite sums**
Let $$\{ f : \mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}\rightarrow\mathbb{R} \}$$ be a function such that $$\sum_{(n,m)\in \mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}} f(n,m)$$ is *absolutely convergent*. Then we have   
<center>$$\sum\limits_{n=0}^\infty \big( \sum\limits_{m=0}^\infty f(n,m) \big) = \sum\limits_{(n,m)\in \mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}} f(n,m) = \sum\limits_{(m,n)\in \mathbb{N}\times\mathbb{N}} f(n,m) = \sum\limits_{m=0}^\infty \big( \sum\limits_{n=0}^\infty f(n,m) \big)$$</center>
In other words, we can switch the order of infinite sums provided that the entire sum is absolutely convergent.   
#### **Converges Example**  
If the *unit-impulse response* or *unit-sample response* decays toward zero, then we say that it converges.  
ROC of Z transform  
$$X(z) = \sum\limits_{n=-\infity}^{\infty} x[n] z^{-n}$$}  
is come from **Geometric series**:  
Let $$x$$ be a complex number, then the series $$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} x^n$$ absolutely converges to $$\frac 1 {1-x}$$ iff $$|x|<1$$.
