> [J]ust because you are capable of building a bikeshed does not mean you should stop others from building one... because you do not like the color they plan to paint it... you need not argue about every little feature just because you know enough to do so.

### Bikeshed honeypots in the corporate world

A *bikeshed honeypot* is a mistake, obvious flaw, or trivial decision that you purposely place (or leave) in a proposal in hopes that those to whom you're seeking input will fixate on the honeypot ("bikeshed"), diverting their attention from the aspects of your proposal that you feel most strongly about. It's the inflatable tanks on D-Day. It's a magician's carefully rehearsed misdirection.

For example, you might propose a new pricing scheme, but make the price point $20.00 instead of $19.99 or suggest a new menu item with a facially uncreative name, in both cases, allowing others to come in and "save the day." The trick is to make it subtle enough that the commenter feels clever and satisfied pointing it out, but not so subtle that it's overlooked entirely (or so substantial that it can't be changed if they don't).

I can't in good conscious advocate that you actually use this tactic (or say that I've used it). You're essentially trolling your audience — saying something in hopes of provoking a specific response, with potentially disastrous consequences. That said, if you've been around corporate culture long enough, there's also a good chance you've seen it before, and now at least have a name for it (or three).
