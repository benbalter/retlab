> Every piecewise continuous function is *Riemann integrable*. Lebesgue integral can handle a very large class of functions, including all the Riemann integrable functions, but also even very discontinuous functions. In fact, it's safe to say that it can integrate any function that one actually needs in mathematics in real-life applications.  
The passage from Riemann's theory of integration to that of Lebesque is a process of completion. It is of the same fundamental importance in analysis as is the construction of the real number system from the rationals.
### **Lebesgue Measure**
I have to pay a certain sum, which I have collected in my pocket. I take the bills and coins out of my pocket and give them to the creditor in the order I find them until I have reached the total sum. This is the Riemann integral. But I can proceed differently. After I have taken all the money out of my pocket I order the bills and coins according to identical values and then I pay the several heaps one after the other to the creditor. This is my integral.

Whenever the Riemann integral exists (i.e.,the limit exists), the Lebesgue integral also exists and has the same value.  
The familiar rules for calculating Riemann integrals also apply for Lebesgue integrals.  
For some very weird functions, the Lebesgue integral exists, but the Riemann integral does not.  
There are also exceptionally weird functions for which not even the Lebesgue integral exists.  
##### **Lebesgue measure**
In Lebesgue integration, the measure $$\{\mu}_m = \{t : m\delta \le u(t) \lt (m+1)\delta \}$$ is called Lebesgue measure.
For any real $$a \le b$$, including $$a = -\infty$$, $$b = \infty$$, the interval $$I = (a, b)$$ has measure $$\mu(I) = b − a$$. Same if either or both end points included.  
The measure of a finite union, $$I_1,\dotsc,I_k$$ of disjoint intervals is the sum of the measure of those intervals, $$\sum_{j=1}^k \mu(I_j)$$.  
The measure of a countable union $$I_1,\dotsc,I_k$$, of disjoint intervals is $$\mu(\cup I_j)=\lim_{k\rightarrow\infty} \sum_{j=1}^k \mu(I_j)$$.  
Any *countable set* of real numbers has zero measure.   
##### **Out measure**
We need more than countable unions of intervals for a viable integration theory. 
If $${\cal B}$$ is measurable, we also need its complement, $$\overline{\cal B}$$, to be measurable with $$\mu({\cal B}) = T − \mu(\cal B})$$.
Define the outer measure $${\mu}^\circ ({\cal A})$$ of any set $${\cal A}$$ as  
$$ {\mu}^\circ ({\cal A}) = inf_{\rm {\cal B}:{\cal B} covers {\cal A}}inf \mu({\cal B})$$.  
where $${\cal B}$$ covers $${\cal A}$$ if $${\cal B}$$ is a countable union of intervals and $${\cal A}\subseteq{\cal B}$$.  
##### **Measurable and Measure**
A set $${\cal A}$$ (over [−T/2, T/2]) is *measurable* if $${\mu}^\circ ({\cal A})+{\mu}^\circ (\overline{\cal A}) = T$$. If $${\cal A}$$ is measurable, then its *measure*, $${\mu}({\cal A})$$, equals $${\mu}^\circ ({\cal A})$$.  
Each measurable set has a measurable complement.  
If $$\cal B \inset \cal B$$ are both measurable, then $$\mu({\cal A}) \le \mu({\cal B})$$.  
Any measurable set can be approximated arbitrarily closely by a cover.  
##### **Lebesgue measure for a union of intervals**
Let $${\cal A}_1, {\cal A}_2,\dotsc$$ be any sequence of measurable sets. Then     
$${\cal S} = \bigcup_{k=1}^\infty {\cal A}_k$$ and $${\cal D} = \bigcap_{k=1}^\infty {\cal A}_k$$ are measurable.  
If $${\cal A}_1, {\cal A}_2,\dotsc$$ are also disjoint, then $$\mu(\cal S) = \sum_k \mu({\cal A}_k)$$.  
If $${\mu}^\circ ({\cal A}) = 0$$, then A is measurable with measure 0.
### **Lebesgue Ingegration**
##### **Measurable functions**
A function $$\{u(t):\mathbb{R}\rightarow\mathbb{R}}$$ is measurable if $${t : u(t) \lt b}$$ is measurable for each $$b\in \mathbb{R}$$.
